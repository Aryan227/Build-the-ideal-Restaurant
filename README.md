# Building the Ideal Restaurant in Bangalore
### Final Project for DSGA3001 (Probability and Statistics - 2)

<h3>Motivation:</h3>
Where (location: city and area) and what type of (cuisine type, budget range, restaurant type) restaurant should we open in Bangalore? 
<br>
Overarchingly, we are interested in this because: We want to see if we can use data science to accurately predict the success of a restaurant based on ratings and reviews of restaurants from 5 years ago. This will be interesting to compare with the restaurants that are currently open to see if the same success metrics would apply today.
<br>
<br>
In initial conversations about answering these questions, we each came up with a preliminary intuitive approach of how we would use this data. Both of our initial intuition was to focus on location first, either to find the part of the city with the most restaurants or the highest ratings. The next step would be to look at the other three variables (cuisine, budget range, and restaurant type) to find the ones that appear the most in the dataset or that have the highest ratings. This intuitive approach produced the following results: 
<br>

<h4>Aryan:</h4>
<ul>Location: BTM </ul>
<ul>Cuisine: Asian, Chinese, Thai, Momos
<ul> Type: Buffet
<ul> Price Range: $$$$


<h4>Mallory:</h4>
<ul>Location: Church Street
<ul>Cuisine: North Indian
<ul>Type: Delivery
<ul>Price Range: $$
<br>
<br>
From this result, it is clear that there are many ways to approach this question which will result in different answers. This approach does not consider underlying relationships in the data that can skew the results.
It is because of this, that we plan to pursue this project and find the best answers through a data science point of view.
